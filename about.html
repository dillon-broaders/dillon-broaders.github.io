        <h2>Hello &#128075;</h2>
        <img src="me.png" class="profile-image" alt="Dillon Broaders">
        <p>
          I am a very recent alumnus of the School of Physics at Trinity College Dublin. 
          In October 2024, I graduated with a Master of Science degree in Quantum Science and Technology, M.Sc. (ST.). 
          My thesis, titled <em>"Petz Recovery for Quantum Processes with Memory,"</em> was completed in collaboration 
          with the Quantum Information Theory Group, where I explored multi-time Petz recovery for quantum systems 
          with non-negligible memory. I am currently continuing this research as an intern in the group.
      </p>
      <p>
          During my Master’s, I developed a strong theoretical foundation in quantum science, focusing on topics such as 
          quantum information theory, tensor networks, quantum materials, and open quantum systems. My interests gravitated 
          toward quantum information theory and open quantum systems, areas I continue to explore in my ongoing research.
      </p>
      <p>Modules completed during my master’s:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Introduction to Quantum Information Science</li>
          <li>Open Quantum Systems</li>
          <li>Quantum Material Science</li>
          <li>Physical Implementation of Quantum Technology</li>
          <li>Quantum Computation and Algorithms</li>
           <li>Special Topics and the Quantum Industry</li>
          <li>Quantum Project</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
          Prior to my Master’s, I completed my undergraduate degree in Physics at Trinity College Dublin. My undergraduate studies 
          provided a well-rounded education that combined theoretical knowledge with practical experience. In addition to core topics 
          such as quantum mechanics, condensed matter physics, electromagnetism, and thermodynamics, the program included laboratory 
          work and exposure to chemistry in the first two years, which deepened my understanding of the physical world from both theoretical 
          and experimental perspectives.
      </p>
      <p>
          It was during my undergraduate studies that I developed a strong interest in computational physics. For my final-year research project, 
          I worked with the Computational Spintronics Group, simulating how disorder affects the magnetic properties of iron lattices 
          (namely the magnetic critical temperature).
      </p>
      <p>
          During this time, I was also elected to serve as a student representative on the Board of the School of Physics (the School Executive). 
          This role gave me a deeper connection to the department and allowed me to contribute to discussions on academic and student affairs. 
          Being part of this decision-making process made me feel truly integrated into the School of Physics and was a rewarding experience.
      </p>
      <p>
          Throughout my studies, I also developed strong programming skills, particularly in Python, with over five years of experience. My programming 
          work spans a variety of applications, from data analysis and numerical simulations to quantum computing libraries like Qiskit. I also have 
          experience with optimization tools like CVXPY and some familiarity with Julia. I continue to build on these skills in my current research work.
